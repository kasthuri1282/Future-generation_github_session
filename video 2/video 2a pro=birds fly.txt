  "prompt": "Transform the input image into a cinematic nature film. Animate the sunrise slowly rising above the mountains. Soft golden light spreads across the valley, volumetric god rays cutting through morning mist. The river subtly shimmers as fog drifts gently. Foreground wildflowers sway naturally in a light breeze. A flock of birds slowly flies across the sky, adding depth and scale. Maintain ultra-realistic textures and a calm, emotional cinematic tone.",
